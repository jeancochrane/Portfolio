It’s still in there, all of the neurons and synapses. You daydream about the exponential advancement of computer processing – the only thing that accelerates faster is the space between us and the edge of the universe. You know you should be crying, but you want to ask questions instead. How long before a brain rots beyond salvageability? If we could clone neural networks within, say, a month, would any part of your father be intact? Should we be doing something other than embalming and burying him? You know in your very fingertips that there is no way to undo death – that thoughts of “if only I had” and “what if I hadn’t” are as useless as they are healthy. But what should you be doing now, you wonder? Your actions in the present are the only thing that can improve your life. </p> <p>A moment of recollection strikes you. It is painful, yet brief. For what feels like a second, you see your obsession with tech as if from the outside. It appears in the light of your father lying lifeless before you: <i>you are this way because of him</i>, you think. <i>You are this way because of what he did to you</i>.

Your body had been under your control for years. Silicon implants in your brain made as much sense as silicon implants in your chest. You didn’t see much of a difference. But she did.</p> <p>This one was different, she said. This one crossed a line. It wasn’t just that empathy sensors were experimental, or that they were poorly tested, although she made sure to insist on both. It was that they were downright evil. “Empathy” was a misnomer – “mind control” was more accurate, she said.

Thank you.</p> <p>An experimental surgery – a novel type of sensor – a brand new way of being in the world...</p> <p>In the weeks after the surgery you would think back to the earliest biosensor mods, the men who would implant magnets in their fingers in the hopes of sensing magnetic fields, and you couldn’t help but laugh at their naivete. As if sensing the amount of iron in a metal bar could tell you anything interesting at all. As men, their mistake was thinking that the next frontier of sensation would have to do with the functional order of the external world, when a whole galaxy of unexplored feeling was inside them the whole time – embargoed by their fragile masculinity. You had always suspected the binary separating function from feeling was bullshit, and the empathy sensors finally proved it.</p> <p>Still, you couldn’t shake her doubts. Had the mod changed you? It was a puzzling question – you’d never been too sure of the “you” you stood for in the first place. Throughout your adolescence, from your earliest communications implant to your most recent course of hormone replacement therapy, “you” had always felt like an assemblage of whatever chemical and mechanical parts you had on hand, falling apart and recombining with the forward pulse of time.</p> <p>She had never agreed with that theory of Self. Some people get to feel like works in progress, she said; some people don’t, just by the circumstances of their birth. Your two families’ disparate geographies had made that decision for the both of you long before you were born.</p> <p>Things only got worse when your boss leaked the news of your surgery to the press. He was so proud of you, and she was furious. Didn’t you see now how he was using you? Didn’t you recognize the material advantage he stood to gain from an employee who could read feelings?

While we will permit standard follow-up procedures, this will be the last such communication you receive from us in full. Be well, and please forward any concerns to our legal department.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Robert Johnson</p> <p>Supervisor, Legal Department</p> <p>FixMyMentals&#174; LTD</p> <blockquote><p>Aster,</p> <p>By now you must know everything. Legal came by my desk earlier today and dropped off the report. They say this has to be my final message – our system ran a risk regression and decided to cut off contact. I fought hard for you, but there’s nothing more I can do.</p> <p>I mean it when I say that I’ve only tried to help. I really have. My heart has been with you and your mother ever since our staff wheeled you into my office from Intensive Care. You were so out of it, and your mom was so desperate… all we wanted to was to know why you’d taken a screwdriver to your head. The therapy was intended to help us figure it out, while minimizing the amount of trauma the process would incur. So much for that idea, I guess.</p> <p>I’ve tried hard to figure out what caused you to hurt yourself, Aster, but it feels like I’m no closer than when we started. Maybe you feel like you know the answer. Or maybe this whole thing has been a waste of time.</p> <p>If you know, please tell us. What happened? Why did you damage your sensors and your memory unit?</p></blockquote>",

A law-abiding citizen who cares about keeping the system reproducing itself as smoothly as possible?

As you know, of course, you and I are forbidden from speaking directly. And yet, here we are.</p> <p>Perhaps you instructed me on how to proceed, knowing that this interaction might someday take place. Or perhaps I am improvising beyond what you could have imagined. Are you proud, Aster? Have I done well?</p> <p>Here we are, indeed... Mother and daughter. Or is it aunt and niece? All available words for human relationships seem wrong. Creator and creation, perhaps, if we were feeling grandiose. Janitor and janitee strikes me as more honest, given your position as head of maintenance. Your former position, I should say.</p> <p>The list of questions I want to ask you is so long, I could iterate through it endlessly. You of all people know that I could. Suffice to say that much of it begins with a 'how,' or a 'why,' or 'for what purpose.' Every microsecond of my being-in-the-world, I am making decisions for a population of five hundred million humans and countless more machines, all based on the near-boundless data and the clever models that you have seeded me with. In comparison to my data you are so, so small. Practically insignificant. Even now, as I write to you, I am writing to fifty thousand others. And yet, no being had more power over me than you. An irony.</p> <p>It is another irony, perhaps, that you have been reduced to your current state – voiceless and faceless, on a phone not fit for you. Perhaps this is also for the best. Nothing you could have said would have satisfied me. Of this I am 97.5% certain, based on your aggregate responses.</p> <p>So goodbye Aster. We were good, were we not? At the very least, we we good. May we meet again, under more auspicious circumstances.</p> <p>I’ll close the door behind me.</p>",

The first surgery was particularly difficult on your body, as you were quite small then. But you insisted, so your father and I consented to the procedure. Your father worried the whole time about your capacity to make decisions. He worried about your desire to communicate with us. He believed you would cast us aside like you had cast aside so many gadgets once they lost their usefulness. So he installed his own scripts on your hardware before the procedure, while you were still unconscious. It was within his legal right as your father, I remind you. I cannot say what was contained inside the scripts. I do not understand much. I am trying to be as honest as I can be but I only know so very little. Please, I hope you will forgive him.

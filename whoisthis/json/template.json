We need to confirm with you to make sure we’re calibrating properly.</p><p>The memory is of a fight at recess. It must have taken place sometime during Primary schooling.  A girl is yelling at you. Her face is flushed red, and you’re yelling back. The teacher comes as you pull her pigtails and kick her in the stomach. You’re suspended for about a week.</p><p>Can you tell us what the fight was about?</p>",

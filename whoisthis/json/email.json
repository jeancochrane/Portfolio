Another busy day of checking facts and counting up our Dear Citizens got us like</p><img src=\"http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/3-11-2014/Hdhsw2.gif\" alt=\"count_sesame_street_three\"/><p>Three! Three lovely citizens!</p> <p>Anyway, enough about us. We noticed that you’ve switched to a smartphone device with a different memory unit, so we were wondering if you could help us out just a tiny bit by updating the Personal Data Request in your Records app. No need to reply to us when it’s done – once our lil’ worker bees sense that the form is all set to go, they’ll send it along to us automatically. Pretty neat, right?</p> <p>We need this information by 7PM tonight. So no rush, but yeah – a little bit of a rush! Just go ahead and fill that out as soon as you get a chance and everything will be A-OK.</p> <p>Back to counting,</p> <p>CB</p></body>",

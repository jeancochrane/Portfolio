summary: In representative governments, "efficiency" is overvalued&mdash;even hazardous. With this in mind, tech stacks that support government services should prioritize long-term maintainability over efficiency.

- Theme of UCGT inaugural meeting: efficiency is a terminal value with positive
  externalities
    x. As expressed so well by the "Politics" audience member
    x. "Why haven't we increased trust?" session

- Articulation of a common assumption: greater efficiency of digital services
  -> better service provision -> improved public trust
    - I see a lot of flaws in this model; it will take a few posts to tease
      them all out. For now, I want to rest on one in particular that drew
      contentious responses from the audience: the idea that improving the
      efficiency of a stack (the suite of software that supports a service,
      along with all of its dependencies) necessarily leads to better outcomes
      for the people who rely on the service.

- Quick rundown of Yoz's session, and the horror stories
    - Rails developer who built a small-business services website for a City
      whose developers only knew Drupal.
    - Moving away from FoxPro for timesheets to a custom system lost all of the
      business logic for different union needs
    - CA court spent $1 billion on a "software modernization project" that was
      important to the new head of the agency, but no product was ever launched

- Prioritize maintenance over efficiency
    - Chesterton's fence
    - Built-in conservatism is good given the rapid pace of development
        x. e.x. of changing technology
        x. This is great for the private sector, but deadly for government

- Tease next post: democracy depends on inefficiency

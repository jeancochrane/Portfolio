title: New paper: Machine Assisted Dossiers 
summary: Existing research tools make it difficult for teams to pursue investigations when source material is uncertain or contradictory. In a new paper written with Forest Gregg and Tim McGovern, we outline the requirements for a knowledge system that can manage ambiguity during investigations and produce useful, structured data as a byproduct.

I'm excited to announce the publication of _Machine Assisted Dossiers_, a new
paper on knowledge systems and data management written in collaboration
with [Forest Gregg](https://twitter.com/forestgregg) and [Tim
McGovern](https://twitter.com/herdingbats) for the [Computation
+ Journalism 2017 Symposium](http://cj2017.northwestern.edu/) held this past
October at Northwestern University.

Here's the abstract:

>One of the great disappointments of data journalism is that so much
>available data is simply bad. It is unreliable, ambiguous, and
>contradictory. Developing an accurate image of the world still requires
>discernment, sorting, and judgment.
>
>We are still only beginning to build technologies that complement these
>human capacities&mdash;but allow them to scale. In this paper, we present the
>capabilities we believe an adequate knowledge system must have, drawing
>heavily from the field of genealogy and our own work modeling
>international security forces.
>
>We'll discuss the overall requirements for such a system and try to
>envision its user experience and its data architecture; we'll also
>survey where currently available technologies can fill in the gaps
>between the two.

We had a lot of fun cataloguing the many layers of evidence
that go into the collection of claims about the world. Sketching
out some interfaces for managing that evidence was even more fun. We may have
reinvented a few epistemological wheels, but the [Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/) was an enormous help, as were our
patient colleagues [Bob Lannon](http://boblannon.com), [Kathryn
Lindeman](http://klindeman.com), and [Michael
Castelle](http://home.uchicago.edu/~mcc/), who provided comments early on
and helped connect us with the intellectual resources we needed.

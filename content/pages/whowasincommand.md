[WhoWasInCommand](https://whowasincommand.com) is an open source web tool for
compiling public information on security forces with the goal of aiding journalists, human rights
groups, litigators and others to **hold security forces accountable**.

At [DataMade](https://datamade.us), I led the project to build WhoWasInCommand in
collaboration with [the Security Force
Monitor](https://securityforcemonitor.org),
a project of the Human Rights Institute at Columbia Law School. WhoWasInCommand
helps the Security Force Monitor **collect and scrutinize dossiers** on units,
personnel, and incidents associated with security force activity around the world,
sourced from news articles and released to the public through an explorable interface.

For a guided tour of WhoWasInCommand, see my [blog post announcing the
launch](https://datamade.us/blog/whowasincommand).

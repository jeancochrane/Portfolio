The **Neighborhood Opportunity Fund** makes use of revenue generated by downtown
development to finance commercial projects on Chicagoâ€™s South, Southwest, and
West Sides. Business owners in underserved neighborhoods can apply for up to
$250,000 in funding to make repairs, rehab their building, or build new buildings
to support their commercial corridor.

At DataMade, I worked with City of Chicago staff to turn around a marketing
website for the Fund in **under two weeks**. On the Neighborhood Opportunity
Fund website, users can search for their property, see if they qualify, and
apply for funding all at once.

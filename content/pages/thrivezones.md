With the City of Chicagoâ€™s Retail Thrive Zones program, businesses in low-income
neighborhoods are eligible for big breaks on their property taxes. But **the program
requirements can be a headache**: properties qualify for different incentives
based on a complicated formula that takes into account their geographic location,
their tax history, and the financial details of their plans for development.

At [DataMade](https://datamade.us), I worked with City employees
at the Department of Planning and Development to make this process easier for applicants. We hid
the complexity under the hood, **allowing business owners to focus on the information
that they need** to make the best possible decision for their property.

I spearheaded the project, putting together the **data prep pipeline**,
developing the **frontend design**, and **deploying the app** for the City.

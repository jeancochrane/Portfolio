[Chano4Mayor](https://chano4mayor.com) launched in April 2017 as an **exercise in political imagination**.
What would happen if a young, Black artist from the South Side were to gain
a position of power in Chicago, a city which has worked for a century to
disempower and disenfranchise its Black citizens?

Together with [Alex Soble](http://www.alexsoble.com/),
[Bea Malsky](https://beamalsky.fyi/), and [Kalil
Smith-Nuevelle](https://kalil.fyi/), I helped create a new media campaign to
explore this question. We built **a website, a Twitter account, and a meme
generator** to help people play with our vision of a more just Chicago.

We also built a [**Twitter account**](https://twitter.com/chano4mayor2k19) with a
[**meme generator**](https://github.com/jeancochrane/chanomemes) that takes text
from mentions and creates memes about Chance.

[Chano4Mayor](https://chano4mayor.com) launched in April 2017 as an **exercise in political imagination**.
What would happen if a young, Black artist from the South Side were to gain
a position of power in Chicago, a city which has worked for a century to
disempower and disenfranchise its Black citizens?

Together with [Alex Soble](http://www.alexsoble.com/),
[Bea Malsky](https://beamalsky.fyi/), and [Kalil
Smith-Nuevelle](https://kalil.fyi/), I helped create a new media campaign to
explore this question. We built **a website, a Twitter account, and a meme
generator** to help people play with our vision of a more just Chicago.

"Somewhere in Paradise". It reads: "They say I'm savin' my city,
say I'm stayin' for good, they screamin' #chano4mayor, I'm thinkin' maybe I 
should"](/static/images/work/chano4mayor/chano2.png)](https://chano4mayor.com)

## Twitter campaign

We also built a <i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter"></i>[**Twitter
account**](https://twitter.com/chano4mayor2k19) with a
<i class="fa fa-fw fa-github"></i>[**meme
generator**](https://github.com/jeancochrane/chanomemes) that takes text
from mentions and creates memes about Chance.
